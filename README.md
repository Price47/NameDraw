# Secret Santa Name Draw

## *About*
Draw names randomly, esuring everyone gets picked and doesn't get
themselves, then outputs everyone's picks into txt files so whoever runs
this doesn't know everyone's secret santa

## *Running*
Super simple, just run

`python draw.py <names>`

with all the names you want to draw for, space seperated

For example:

`python draw.py Han Luke Vader Leia Chewie C3PO Lando R2D2`

and you'll get 8 txt files to distribute to your participants.

Fun, simple, and festive
